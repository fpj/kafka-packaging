Description: Apache Kafka is publish-subscribe messaging rethought as a distributed commit log
 Apache Kafka is
  * Fast: A single Kafka broker can handle hundreds of megabytes of reads and
    writes per second from thousands of clients.
  * Scalable: Kafka is designed to allow a single cluster to serve as the
    central data backbone for a large organization. It can be elastically and
    transparently expanded without downtime. Data streams are partitioned and
    spread over a cluster of machines to allow data streams larger than the
    capability of any single machine and to allow clusters of co-ordinated
    consumers
  * Durable: Messages are persisted on disk and replicated within the cluster to
    prevent data loss. Each broker can handle terabytes of messages without
    performance impact.
  * Distributed by Design: Kafka has a modern cluster-centric design that offers
    strong durability and fault-tolerance guarantees.
